4. Prebuilt Intents:
Dialogflow has prebuilt agents that are trained to understand a large number of queries, like Weather, Traffic, E-commerce, Ccy Exchange, Hotel bookings etc.
The intents from these prebuilt agents are very easy to migrate to other agents

If second option is chosen, the function handlers can be configured directly from Dialogflow portal (quick and easy)

Aprox 2-3s for simple voice request

Around 100 for weather or current location requests

8. Known limitations:
No limitations are known so far apart from the requests quotas

9. Unique features:
- Small talk: 
No extra training or intents needed for the agent to be able to reply to several conversational queries like 
"Who are you?" "You're annoying" "Who's your boss" "You're amazing" "You are smart" "Will you marry me?" etc.
- Knowledge Base: The agent can be fed with up to 10MB / request of files containing FAQs or articles from which the agent can answer questions
- Quick integrations with Google Cloud Functions (NodeJS) and Google Cloud TTS 
(still in beta: although the JSON response contains the audio file represented as a binary object, currently this cannot be rendered in Android)

10. Ease of testing:
Dialogflow has unlimited text queries in its free plan and a readily available web integration for the agent (no need to open the phone app to actually test the agent)
For Google Cloud Functions fulfillments, the Google Firebase Console provides readable logs for debugging.
These features make debugging very easy and straightforward in Dialogflow.

11. Ease of maintainance post integration:
Although the Google Cloud console is very user friendly and easy to pick-up, offering comprehensive logs and debugging tools, 
maintaining the Agent would still have to be done from an entirely different console to the AWS one
